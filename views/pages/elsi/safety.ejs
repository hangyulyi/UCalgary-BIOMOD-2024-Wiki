            <h1>Safety Hazards</h1>
            <p>Certain potential losses must be accounted for when working with patients and potential hazards in-lab. Losses are not attributed to human error and may include but are not limited to loss impacting stakeholders, environmental damage, injury to persons, etc. Identifying these scenarios ultimately helps to prevent them from occurring and aid the generation of appropriate emergency responses. This approach to hazard analysis is referred to as a Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). The STPA varies from other methods as it treats accidents as losses of control rather than outright failure. Thoroughly examining hazards related to all forms of failure allows for a more structured approach to risk mitigation. The first step to performing a STPA is to define a system boundary (to avoid an endless breakdown of a system into small insignificant parts), as well as the losses of the specific system and their associated hazards. In regards to the proposed biosensor, the following nine potential losses were considered:</p> <br>

            <p>The second step of an STPA is to create a control structure, which clearly denotes a hierarchy of control within staff and describes the impact different pieces of the system have on one another. This is done with the goal of identifying potentially hazardous system interactions and ensures there is no confusion as to who overrides whom in an emergency scenario. Next, the third step is to identify any Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs). UCAs are actions derived from the control structure that could ultimately lead to a hazard. Lastly, step five consists of the identification of causal scenarios, which are actions that could lead to the previously identified unsafe control actions. A risk mitigation plan can then be created with the goal of preventing hazards/losses through avoidance of UCAs as well as causal scenarios. Through examining the various potential hazards associated with both the production and use of our proposed biosensor, the team can be proactive in regards to risk mitigation. Implementing a robust and comprehensive emergency protocol will help reduce confusion and lessen the damages and/or losses that could occur in certain situations. This would also result in more informed, prepared, and trained staff. </p>

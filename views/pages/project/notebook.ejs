            <p>This was our first week in the lab; however, we mainly focused on dry lab tasks. We also prepared for the Tech Futures Challenge (TFC), which was an opportunity for us to practice presenting for BIOMOD and possibly win monetary prizes! Meagan, our Dry Lab lead, worked on simulation software like Maya, Cadnano, Chimera and OxDNA. Using Cadnano, she was able to make a 72hb nanopore!! We also looked into selecting the aptamer and the target, and a lot of literature review to verify our summer plans.</p>

            <p>This week, we discovered the student lounge in the building!! It includes little tables to eat, but more importantly, a pool table, a foosball table, and a ping-pong table! We also decided to start a Duolingo competition to see who could get the longest streak before we leave for Japan (learning Japanese, of course)! Whoever wins this competition will receive a tiramisu paid for by the other team members!
                <br><br></p>
                Our team largely applied to funding opportunities this week because flights to Japan are EXPENSIVE!! Meagan continued to look into more dry lab software, like UniFold, RNAComposer, Autodock, and with the help of Ziyad and Emma, OxDNA, and docking through HADDOCK. Meagan was able to use RNAComposer to get a pub file of our aptazyme!  We also started working on finalizing some of our protocols, specifically the GUV formation, gel, nanopore insertion, and dye flux assay protocol. Sana sent out our first materials list (with the lab discount because money is tight), so hopefully we can get into wet lab work soon!

            <li>12µL of 1kB plus DNA ladder was added</li>
            <li>Mix everything in the tube with a pipette before loading</li>
            <li>Load the samples</li>
            <li>When loading, don’t go to the second stop in the pipette to avoid introducing air bubbles into the gel</li>
            <li>The first lane was skipped since it looked a little squished</li>

        <strong>Notes/Observations:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Started running gel at 2:24 pm, stopped at 5 pm</li>
            <li>The negative control sample (lane 6) was moving the slowest</li>
            <li>Checked gel at 3:24 pm, had not traveled past the halfway point</li>
            <li>Decided to let the gel keep running until it at least made it to the halfway point</li>
            <li>Nick suggested running future gels at 120V for closer to 30 mins.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Mass of agarose used was 0.9934g instead of 1g.</li>
            <li>The first gel attempt failed because the gel solidified in the Erlenmeyer flask once the formaldehyde and TBE buffer was added.</li>
            <li>Do not let the gel cool too much before adding the formaldehyde/TBE mixture.</li>
            <li>A pipette tip was used to mix the SYBR Safe that wasn’t mixed properly once the gel was poured onto the casting tray.</li>
            <li>The gel casting apparatus was not leveled flat completely.</li>
            <li>Gel was stored overnight from 4:30 pm 13/06/24 to 14/06/24.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Weigh out a 2% agarose gel in an Erlenmeyer flask: 3 grams for a 150mL gel.</li>
                    <li>Add running buffer to the flask and swirl to mix. (Use milli-q water to dilute the buffer to 150mL).</li>
                    <li>Melt the agarose/buffer mixture in a microwave in 30-second intervals, swirling between intervals until dissolved.</li>
                    <li>Once the flask is cool enough to touch, add 15µL of SYBR Safe dye.</li>
                    <li>Place the gel tray in the casting apparatus and insert the comb to create wells.</li>
                    <li>Pour the agarose into the mold and allow it to set at room temperature. Remove the comb and place the gel in the gel tank with DNA running from negative to positive.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Running Gel</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add 1µL of loading dye to 5µL of each DNA sample (10µL total volume per sample).</li>
                    <li>Set the power supply to 120V (adjustable to 1-5V/cm between electrodes).</li>
                    <li>Cover the gel with running buffer (~700mL) and attach the leads to the power supply.</li>
                    <li>Load DNA samples and a DNA size marker (12µL) into the wells.</li>
                    <li>Close the lid, check connections, and run the gel for approximately 30 minutes or until dye has migrated an appropriate distance.</li>
                </ol>

        <strong>Results:</strong><br>
        <img src="/img/gel4.jpg" alt="Gel"><br>
        Figure 1: The bands for all wells were very faint; will do another set.
Possible reasons for the faint bands could be that the amount of templates were not sufficient. 5 uL of template DNA was mixed with 1 uL of DNA loading dye.

        img src="/img/gel5.jpg" alt="Gel"><br>
        Figure 2: During this round of gel, the protocol was followed and 10 uL of template DNA was mixed with 2 uL of loading dye. However, there was a band noticeable in the control lane. Possible reasons could be that the mixtures weren’t loaded on the gel properly or that PCR did not work as intended.

        <strong>Preparation of the Gel</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Weigh out a 2% agarose gel in an Erlenmeyer flask (3 grams of agarose for a 150mL gel).</li>
            <li>Add the correct volume of running buffer to the agarose-containing flask and swirl to mix.
                <ul>
                    <li>(1X) TBE or TAE buffer</li>
                    <li>Use milli-q water to dilute to 150mL</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Melt the agarose/buffer mixture in a microwave at 30-second intervals, removing the flask to swirl the contents. Repeat until the agarose has completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Cool the flask until it is safe to touch, then add 15µL of SYBR Safe dye.</li>
            <li>Clean and place the gel tray into the casting apparatus, then place an appropriate comb into the gel mold to create wells.</li>
            <li>Pour the molten agarose into the gel mold and allow it to set at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Once set, remove the comb and place the gel in the gel tank, ensuring the direction of DNA runs from negative to positive.</li>

            <li>Preparation of the Gel:
                <ul>
                    <li>Weigh out 3 grams of agarose for a 150 mL gel in an Erlenmeyer flask to create a 2% agarose gel.</li>
                    <li>Add the correct volume of 1X TAE or TBE buffer to the agarose-containing flask and swirl to mix.</li>
                    <li>Use deionized water to dilute (150 mL).</li>
                    <li>Melt the agarose/buffer mixture in a microwave in 30-second intervals, removing the flask and swirling to mix well. Repeat until the agarose has completely dissolved.</li>
                    <li>Allow the flask to cool down enough to touch (without burning), and add 15 µL of SYBR Safe dye.</li>
                    <li>Clean and place the gel tray into the casting apparatus. Insert an appropriate comb to create the wells.</li>
                    <li>Pour the molten agarose into the gel mold. Let it set at room temperature.</li>
                    <li>Remove the comb and place the gel in the gel tank. Ensure DNA runs from negative to positive.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>PCR Setup:

        <strong>Purpose/Objective of the lab:</strong> To determine concentrations of stock oligonucleotides and assess whether the lack of DNA bands is due to the sample being below the detection ng/µL of the gel. <br>
        <strong>Last Edited (yy/mm/dd):</strong> Not provided <br>

        <strong>Materials:</strong>
        <ul>

            <li>Kimwipe</li>
            <li>RNase-free deionized water</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Procedure:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Blank the Nanodrop using 1 µL of RNase-free water.</li>
            <li>Vortex each sample, then load 1 µL of each sample onto the Nanodrop.</li>
            <li>Wipe the Nanodrop surface using a Milli-Q water-dampened Kimwipe between each sample.</li>
            <li>Note absorbance values and the A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Notes/Observations:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial recordings gave negative absorbance values, which were resolved by vortexing the samples before pipetting and re-running the experiment.</li>
            <li>Values presented reflect the results from the last run only.</li>
            <li>The Nanodrop was set to measure ssDNA for the primers and dsDNA for the template.</li>
            <li>Next time, run each sample three times and average the values to account for calibration or anomaly issues.</li>

        Figure 1. 2% agarose gel ran for 1:21(time) at 100mA. Gel was visualized with SYBR Safe. Lanes were loaded with the following: lane 1 skipped, lane 2: negative control (AP’s primers), lane 3: positive control (DNA from TranscriptAid Transcription Kit). lane 4: AP (no product seemed to form), lane 5: APL, lane 6: APTMSD, lane 7: 1kB ladder.
        <br>
    Interpretation:<br>
    It seems the issue is the PCR machine and maybe a faulty ladder. We should use the old PCR machine from now, using a new SuperMix ideally if possible (but the SuperMix has been ruled out as contaminated). Also next gel try using different ladders to ensure which ladder is working fine.

        <ul>
            <li>2% Agarose</li>
            <li>1X TBE or TAE Buffer</li>
            <li>Milli-Q Water</li>
            <li>SYBR Safe dye</li>
            <li>Gel Tray and Casting Apparatus</li>
            <li>Comb</li>
            <li>DNA Samples</li>
            <li>6X Loading Dye</li>
            <li>DNA Size Marker</li>
            <li>Power Supply</li>
            <li>UV Transilluminator</li>
            <li>Gel Documentation System (Gel Doc)</li>
            <li>Erlenmeyer Flask</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Procedure:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>DNA agarose gel electrophoresis</strong></li>
            <li>The procedure was followed as directed:</li>

            <strong>Preparation of the Gel:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Weigh out a 2% agarose gel in an erlenmeyer flask (3 grams of agarose for a 150mL gel).</li>
                <li>Add the correct volume of running buffer to the agarose-containing flask. Swirl to mix.</li>
                <li>(1X) TBE or TAE buffer, use milli-Q water to dilute (150mL).</li>
                <li>Melt the agarose/buffer mixture in a microwave, at 30 s intervals, remove the flask and swirl the contents to mix well. Repeat until the agarose has completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Wait until the flask is cooled enough to touch the skin, add 15µL of SYBR Safe dye.</li>
                <li>Clean and place the gel tray into the casting apparatus. Place an appropriate comb into the gel mold to create the wells.</li>
                <li>Pour the molten agarose into the gel mold. Allow the agarose to set at room temperature.</li>
                <li>Remove the comb and place the gel in the gel tank, ensuring the DNA runs from negative to positive.</li>
            </ul>
